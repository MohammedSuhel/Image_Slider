# Image_Slider
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS and Java Script.
<br/>
CSS is great for styling and animations, but it cannot handle dynamic interactions like clicking buttons, switching slides, or detecting touch gestures.So i have used JavaScript to update the active slide, enable navigation arrows, allow thumbnail selection, and support touch/swipe gestures on mobile.
